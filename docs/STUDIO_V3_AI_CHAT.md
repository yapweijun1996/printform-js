# Studio v3 framework-native Pi authoring

The sidepanel keeps a bounded conversation and composer. Send is the deliberate
action accepting the adjacent recipient/context notice. No consent checkbox
or background send is used. Enter sends; Shift+Enter and IME Enter do not.
Exact initial JSON remains inspectable in Sharing details. If current context
differs from the displayed request, Send refreshes it and stops before inference.

Edit scope is derived, not chosen: elements added with Add to chat limit the edit to
those references; with none, the whole form is editable. A proposal that touches
anything outside the references is rejected (`UNSAFE_SCOPE`).

## Authoring and questions

Ordinary questions use a closed answer envelope and remain read-only. Font
questions use measured computed typography in the committed sandbox preview,
with stable label/value/title/page-number IDs. Zoom is separate from print size.
Missing measurements are explicitly unavailable.

Edits use a proposal with either the legacy style/width edits or at most 24
framework-native operations. The canonical design contract and capabilities are
in [Authoring](STUDIO_V3_AUTHORING.md). Operations can add/remove/reorder fields
and columns, author labels and nonfinancial static text, rebind supported source
paths, set independent label/value styles, section layout/order/pagination,
paper geometry and existing embedded raster assets. No arbitrary HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, shell, filesystem, formula or model code runs.

Existing numeric-bound fields cannot become static/image or receive replacement
text/format. Financial-bound fields additionally retain their existing pointer.
New static financial/number fields are rejected. Labels, styles and structural
placement remain editable. ERP dataset values and calculations never change.

Whole template permits the supported design surface. Selected section permits
its actual owned children. A selected field permits only itself and its exact
label; label selection permits only label/showLabel/labelStyle. Similar ID
prefixes do not establish ownership. Referenced selections can contain up to
eight stable elements, each with up to 500 characters of user comments.
Add to chat is available from paper, structure and properties. Chips support
remove, highlight and locate. Deleted, older, cross-document or recovered tags
block Send until explicitly removed and added again.

## Bounded inspected run

One Send uses the pinned real Pi AgentHarness/MemorySessionRepo and Demo provider
extension. The gateway accepts ordinary text completions; local validated
operations implement authoring. A run allows at most three model requests and
three real isolated print-preview inspections, with Stop and a 60-second
client timeout. Invalid proposals or blocked geometry can trigger a repair
within that cap. A blocked final candidate is never reported as passing.

Each repair resends the reviewed context and previous model proposal. Newly
added local diagnostics are allowlisted error codes, known component IDs,
geometry and numeric counts only. No rendered text, samples, amounts, raw
images, selectors, files or diagnostic messages enter that dynamic boundary.
Context identity, data, revision, selection, references and epoch are rechecked
before each remote request and around every local inspection.

The final candidate has one complete Before/After diff, including implicit
binding cleanup and added/removed field definitions. Local inspection never
commits. The user must still choose Preview and then Apply. Apply requires
current passing layout/data checks and draft Apply/Discard/Stay protection,
then rechecks identity at CommandBus queue execution. It creates one history
entry. Card Undo is bound to that exact bus/revision/epoch. Printing/exporting
are disabled while an unapplied candidate is visible, including restore failures.

## Disclosure and storage

Initial automatic context contains stable IDs, types, style/structure numeric
settings, measured font facts, known framework/declared-schema pointer paths
and types, and at most six recent eligible messages capped at 3,000 characters.
Raw dataset object keys are never enumerated for AI; custom paths explicitly
typed in the request/comments can be resolved locally without exposing values.
Row-relative candidates identify their collection, so collection and columns
can change atomically. Secret-like declared keys are omitted.

Business labels/text, dataset values, amounts and asset bytes are not automatic
context. User-entered requests/comments and eligible conversation are shared
as disclosed. Recovered text stays untrusted. No gateway registration, grant,
private key or provider native tool configuration changes. Discovery sends no
document. Demo tokens and Pi sessions remain memory-only and are cleared.
Usage is reported only when supplied; if any step lacks usage, aggregate usage
is unavailable. A client timeout cannot undo a request already received remotely.

Conversation retains 12 messages capped at 4,000 characters. Validated diff
history shares the parser's 360-entry cap. Keep work & update retains only
whitelisted text/diffs/input and inert references, within the existing 4 MiB
verified local backup guard. Recovered proposals never regain Preview/Apply;
references require fresh re-addition. Failed recovery keeps the protected backup.
Desktop resizing, mobile paper-return and normal draft/database protections
remain available. Native printer output and visual design still need owner review.
